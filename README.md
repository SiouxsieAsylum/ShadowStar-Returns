# ShadowStar Returns
## A website by Andrea McKenzie

This is the first iteration of a website for Shadow Star returns, a short film by up-and-coming director, James McKenzie. 

'Shadowstar Returns' takes place in a violent inner-city neighborhood that was once protected by a vigilante named Shadowstar, but the hero has since disappeared and left the residents of the town to fend for themselves. So when Keiran and Tyriq decide to run away from the hood and never look back, they run into trouble in the form of vicious gangs and violent cops. With no heroes around to protect them, will they make it out?

This is one of my first projects for Per Scholas, a non-profit school I attended dedicated to teaching IT and coding skills to the under-represented in tech.
